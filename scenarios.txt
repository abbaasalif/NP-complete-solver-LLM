travelling salesman problem
I have a challenging traveling salesman problem involving 20 cities spread over a large region. The distances between these cities vary significantly, and I have compiled a detailed distance matrix. I need to determine the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. Please help me solve this problem.

City1, City2, City3, City4, City5, City6, City7, City8, City9, City10, City11, City12, City13, City14, City15, City16, City17, City18, City19, City20

Knapsack problem

I need to solve a knapsack problem where I have a list of items, each with a specific weight and value. My goal is to select a subset of these items that maximizes the total value without exceeding a certain weight capacity. The items are provided in a detailed list, and I want to know which items to pack to get the highest benefit. Please help me determine the optimal selection.

Graph Coloring

I have a scheduling problem that can be modeled as a graph coloring problem. Each vertex in the graph represents a class, and an edge between two vertices indicates a conflict (i.e., the classes cannot be scheduled at the same time). I need to assign colors (time slots) to each class so that no two conflicting classes share the same color, while using as few colors as possible. Please help me find a valid coloring solution.
